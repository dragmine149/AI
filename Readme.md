# AI

Welcome to a git repo of my adventures with AI (specifically chatgpt) and the things that have happened.
Each folder is a different adventure with different outcomes. Mainly a simple challlenge and then the result (after a lot of back and forth)

## Calendar Create

The first project, creating a calendar from data. If you want to see the result, go to [here](./CalendarCreate/) If you want to have a go, go to [here](./CalendarCreate/Challenge/Readme.md)
