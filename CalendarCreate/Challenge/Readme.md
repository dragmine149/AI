# Calendar Create Challenge

## Notes

    This has been slightly modified from the original inputs.
    Data will be provided per challenge

There is currently no UI part due to me not actually talking to the AI about the ui and getting a working ui.

## Rules + Info

    1. The challenge is seperated up into different parts, this is similar to what i gave the AI.
    2. No looking at other parts before the first part is completed.
    3. Fell free to make a pull request or something once you are done. Maybe send me a notification on twitter o mastodon.

## Parts

[Getting Started: Part1](Part1.md)
